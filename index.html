                <h1>Me</h1>
                <p>I am a 15 year old boy who lives near Ottawa in Canada. I am currently attending a mini-course program -Introduction to Full Stack Development- at Carleton University.</p>
                <h1>My Brothers</h1>
                <p>I have 3 younger brothers. The oldest is 12, the middle is 8, and the youngest is 6. The oldest does competitive swimming and the youngest does jujutsu.</p>
                <h1>My Goals</h1>
                <p>I want to get into a good University to study something in the sciences and maths (potentially computer sciences). I also want to get a lifeguarding job soon so I can save money to pay my tuition.</p>

                <h1>Dungeons and Dragons</h1>
                <p>
                    While me and my friends have not found time to play DnD recently, it is a game that we enjoy playing. The thing I love the most about DnD is that it is your own adventure using your own imagination with levels and rules that are only there as a guide. You decide where you want to go and what you want to do in this fantasy adventure.
                </p>
                <h1>Card games</h1>
                <p>
                    I enjoy many types of card games and board games. Me and my friends end up playing board games and cards most of the time we hang out. My family also has a boardgame night, and the favourite board games (and card games) I enjoy playing with them are exploding kittens and Catan. I also like trading card games such as pokemon and Magic, both the thrill of opening a pack and seeing what cards I get as well as actually playing the game. While I know how to play the pokemon TCG, I prefer to collect the cards. It is the opposite for Magic, where I enjoy playing the actual card game a lot more.
                </p>
                <h1>Basketball</h1>
                <p>
                    I have been playing basketball since I was 7, and it has been my favourite sport for a long time. I no longer play competitive since it takes a lot of time and commitment, and I have other things I want to do. However, I still enjoy playing casual at parks and outdoor basketball courts.
                </p>
                <h1>Visual Arts</h1>
                <p>
                    I always liked drawing pictures since I was little, but art at school was never fun for me until middle-school. That is when I really started enjoying art and using it as a way to express my imagination. I frequently sketch small pictures on my class notes when I am bored, and in art class I love painting (watercolour and acrylic) and drawing various landscapes.

                <h1>Academic Studies</h1>
                <p>I go to school at STA and am currently in grade 10. My best subjects are science and mathematics, which are also my favorite. My current total grade average is around 90%.</p>
                <h1>Coding</h1>
                <p>The course where I am making this website is the first time I am ever coding html, css, and java. I have gotten pretty good at html, css and I mostly understand how java works. I barely know how to set up react and not a lot on how it works. That is something I will be working on improving if I have the time.</p>
                <h1>Swimming</h1>
                <p>When I was younger, I took swimming lessons and was on the swim team every summer. I love the ocean, but I never usually get the chance to go to the coast often. Now I am currently training in NLS lifesaving, lifeguard and instructor courses.</p>
                <h1>Public Speaking (not)</h1>
                <p>My communication skills are terrible. I have trouble asking for help because I have difficulty communicating what I need and talking loud. My social skills are not great as a result, and definitely something I need to improve.</p>

                <h1>Designing Websites</h1>
                <p>In the Indroduction to Full Stack Development mini-course program, I am learning how to design websites with html, css, java, etc. While some things have been confusing, I really enjoyed this course and have now found an interest in coding and website design.</p>
                <h1>Volunteer Hours</h1>
                <p>I am currently volunteering as a timer at any of my brother's swim meets that I can. I have done at least 20 hours so far, which contribute to the total of 40 hours needed to graduate high school.</p>
                <h1>Lifeguard Training</h1>
                <p>I have recieved my bronze medallion and cross, as well as my NLS. I am currently taking my instructor course and have applied for a job interview at some outdoor pools near me. I hope to get a part-time or casual job for the summer.</p>
